This is just the simple demo for us to use in the Week 8 presentation.

# How to run?

- Make sure you [generated the Prisma instance](https://goprisma.org/docs/getting-started/quickstart).
- After all, do a `go run .` should work.
  - In case it does not, there is a pre-configured JetBrains IDE environment to run and inspect the database.

# Path

- The API document is at `/docs`, powered by [Scalar](https://scalar.com).
- All the endpoints live behind `/student`.
